Since Nov 2019, I've had a desire to create a story for my nieces and nephew about a house floating through space searching for its home. My hope for the 2nd month of my one-game-one-month challenge is to follow through with completing the story using a visual novel format. 

## Resources Used
[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) - Visual novel and life simulation game engine

[Shawna (aka Feniks Dev)](https://feniksdev.itch.io/) - Referenced their tutorials and guides quite a lot

[Happy Loops by GooseNinja](https://gooseninja.itch.io/happy-loops) - Awesome Music~! Admittedly I'm a bit biased. One of the tracks just happens to be named "Back-Home"

## Blockers Next Steps
**Updated 5/23/2024**
Many difficulties arose this month in my personal life. This project hasn't gotten the time that it deserved. I'll continue to complete as much as I can in the alloted time, however, I'll also allow myself some extra time afterwords if I was to spruce up the art or story.
